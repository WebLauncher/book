Overview
########

The WebLauncher cookbook is an openly developed and community editable documentation
project. We hope to maintain a high level of quality, validity and accuracy for
the documentation. Notice the "Source" button in the upper right-hand
corner; it will direct you to the GitHub online editor of the active page,
allowing you to easily contribute any additions, deletions, or corrections to
the documentation.

Getting Started
===============

Conventions
-----------

Learn about a typical :doc:`WebLauncher request </overview/weblauncher-request>` and the :doc:`conventions </overview/weblauncher-conventions>` that power WebLauncher.

Controllers
-----------

Controllers handle requests and help co-ordinate and prepare
responses for the client. Read more about :doc:`/controllers`.

Views
-----

Views are the presentation layer in WebLauncher. They convert
the data fetched from Models into the output format requested by the
client. Read more about :doc:`/views`.

Models
------

Models are the heart of your application. They handle the validation,
storage and retrieval of your data. Read more about :doc:`/models`.
